# Use TurboFieldfareAgent in Zed or another ACP client

`TurboFieldfareAgent --acp` serves Agent Client Protocol v1 over stdin/stdout.
The terminal REPL remains the default when `--acp` is omitted. The ACP frontend
and REPL share the model runtime, conversation/tool loop, tools and skill loader.

## Zed setup

Build the agent:

```bash
swift build -c release --product TurboFieldfareAgent
```

Add a custom agent to Zed's settings, replacing the executable path with the
absolute path to your checkout's built binary:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "TurboFieldfare": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/turbo-fieldfare/.build/release/TurboFieldfareAgent",
      "args": ["--acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Select **TurboFieldfare** when starting a thread in Zed's Agent Panel. Zed's
`dev: open acp logs` command shows protocol traffic for troubleshooting.
See [Zed's custom agent documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents#custom-agents).

The existing defaults apply:

- Model: `~/Library/Application Support/TurboFieldfare/gemma4.gturbo`.
- Context capacity: 262144 tokens.
- Override with `"args": ["--acp", "--model", "/absolute/path/model.gturbo", "--max-context", "262144"]`.
- There is no agent account/login requirement. The model must already be installed.

Follow the repository's model-run checks before starting inference. Each ACP
process can load one model; separate editor windows/clients may start separate
processes. Do not run these alongside another model process on this checkout.
The model loads lazily on the first inference prompt. Initialization, session
creation, and `/skills` do not load it.

## Supported behavior

- Protocol version negotiation (`initialize`) and new conversations (`session/new`).
- Text, resource links, and embedded text resources in `session/prompt`.
  Links are included as references for the agent to read using tools; they are
  not silently fetched. Image/audio/binary content is rejected explicitly.
- Streamed assistant text and tool status/output notifications.
- UI permission requests before file, shell, URL and MCP tools. Only the explicit
  **Allow once** response authorizes an operation. Missing, rejected, failed or
  cancelled permission responses deny it. Delegated tasks inherit these checks.
- Client file reads/writes when advertised, allowing tools to use unsaved editor
  buffers. Otherwise, approved file tools operate on the local filesystem.
- `session/cancel` during generation, approvals, shell commands and MCP requests.
  Cancellation completes with `stopReason: "cancelled"`; late approval responses
  cannot authorize another turn.
- Per-session working directories, instructions, skill catalogs and MCP clients.
  Relative file paths and shell commands resolve against the session's project.
- Skill names published as ACP available commands. `/name request` loads the
  selected skill on demand; `/skills` lists them.
- Native MCP settings from `~/.config/TurboFieldfareAgent/settings.json`, merged
  with the client's `mcpServers`. Client entries take precedence by server name.
  Stdio and Streamable HTTP are supported; legacy SSE transport is rejected.
  The UI-launched agent must inherit environment variables referenced by native
  settings, such as `BUGCROWD_MCP_AUTH`.

The process keeps separate transcripts for up to 32 sessions and admits one
active prompt globally. Concurrent prompts receive a busy error; cancel or wait
before retrying. Switching sessions invalidates the retained cache record and
replays the selected conversation through the same model instance.

## Boundaries in this first version

- Conversations are in memory until the process exits. `session/load`, persistent
  session listing/restoration, model switching and session modes are not advertised.
- Shell tools execute locally and report their result as tool output. ACP's
  optional client terminal API, live terminal widgets and edit diff previews are
  not implemented. Use local macOS projects; this is not a remote execution bridge.
- Initial model loading/integrity verification is synchronous. Cancellation is
  recorded immediately but cannot interrupt that load; it is checked before
  generation starts.
- Shell operations have a five-minute deadline and retain at most 256 KiB of
  output; the model receives the existing 8192-character shell result limit.
  Stdio MCP requests have a 60-second deadline and an 8 MiB response-buffer limit.
  Cancelled/broken stdio connections are stopped; cancelled sessions rediscover
  their MCP tools on the next inference turn. HTTP uses its existing 60-second
  request timeout. Client permission/file requests time out after five minutes.
- Approvals are not an OS sandbox. Approved tools retain the agent user's normal
  filesystem/network permissions and environment. Child processes that detach
  from their original process group are outside the shell cancellation guarantee.
- Diagnostics go to stderr. Stdout contains only newline-delimited ACP JSON-RPC.
  Input frames are limited to 8 MiB with a bounded queue. A stalled output pipe
  closes the connection after five seconds. EOF, SIGINT and SIGTERM cancel active
  work and clean up owned MCP subprocesses.

## Implementation and validation

`AgentCore` owns session state and the shared model. `AgentTurn` is the common
conversation loop; `AgentInteraction` supplies UI events, approvals, file access
and cancellation. `TerminalGeneration` owns terminal input and presentation.
`ACPServer` handles protocol/session routing while `ACPChannel` correlates client
requests independently of an active prompt. `ACPTransport` handles stdio framing.

Run model-free checks with:

```bash
Scripts/test.sh --filter TurboFieldfareAgentTests
python3 Scripts/test-agent-editor.py
```

The ACP suite includes a real executable handshake, session creation and skills
request over pipes with a deliberately nonexistent model path. It checks clean
protocol stdout and confirms these operations do not load a model. Scripted
backends cover streaming, permissions, cancellation, concurrent-prompt rejection,
client file buffers and unsupported content. Local subprocess fixtures cover
shell cancellation and an MCP server that never answers initialization.

### Validation record — 2026-09-16

Baseline commit: `b33cf38` plus the ACP working-tree changes. Hardware: Apple M2
Pro, 32 GiB RAM. macOS 26.6.2; Apple Swift 6.4
(`swiftlang-6.4.0.34.1 clang-2100.3.34.1`).

| Command | Exit | Complete summary/footer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `swift build -c release --product TurboFieldfareAgent` | 0 | `Build complete! (56.55 sec.)` |
| `Scripts/test.sh --filter TurboFieldfareAgentTests` | 0 | `Build complete! (3.42 sec.)`; `Executed 45 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 5.226 (5.234) seconds` |
| `python3 Scripts/test-agent-editor.py` | 0 | `31 terminal editor checks passed.` |
| `git diff --check` | 0 | No output. |

A Python subprocess smoke check also launched the release executable with
`--acp --model <temporary-directory>/missing.gturbo`, sent `initialize` and
`session/new`, then closed stdin. It exited 0, emitted valid ACP responses and
loaded no model. The XCTest executable checks additionally exercise `/skills`
and graceful SIGTERM shutdown.

One intermediate model-free test run was stopped after diagnosing an unbounded
Foundation `waitUntilExit()` during cancelled MCP cleanup. Bounded cleanup
replaced that wait, and the complete suite passed afterward.

Live model testing stopped at preflight: `ls -l scratch/gemma4.gturbo` reported
`No such file or directory`. Memory-pressure reported 79% system-wide free
memory; disk had 90 GiB available; no matching model process was found. No model
was downloaded, copied, loaded or terminated, and no inference/benchmark run
was attempted. Zed's live UI and real model tool generation have not been tested.
No model-test protocol was bypassed. Build/test cache access required sandbox
escalation; the terminated process was only the model-free test runner launched
for this work.
