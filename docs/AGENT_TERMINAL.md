# Terminal tool responses

In the interactive `TurboFieldfareAgent` terminal, **Ctrl-O** expands all retained
tool responses in place. Press it again to return to their compact previews
(normally 300 characters). The choice also applies to subsequent tool results.
The response shows a shortcut hint beside its output.

The shortcut works while editing a prompt and during generation. Your draft,
insertion point, and the status footer are preserved. At the prompt, **Page Up**
and **Page Down** browse the retained transcript, including expanded responses
longer than the terminal window. Toggling or submitting a prompt returns to the
latest output. Before the first tool response, these shortcuts do nothing.

Expansion shows the complete result returned by the tool; any limit imposed by
the tool itself still applies. It does not change the messages sent to the model.
ACP clients manage their own presentation. Piped input/output and `TERM=dumb`
keep the existing compact output without transcript navigation.

The agent repaints the visible transcript above the footer without opening a
separate view or clearing terminal scrollback. Existing terminal scrollback is
historical and cannot be rewritten; use Page Up/Page Down at the agent prompt to
browse the retained transcript with the current expansion setting.

## Copying responses

Enter `/copy` to copy the latest nonempty assistant answer to the macOS
clipboard as plain Markdown, preserving its original formatting. Tool calls,
tool output, and terminal decoration are excluded. The command reports when
there is no answer to copy or the clipboard write fails. It does not submit a
prompt to the model.

Verification for `/copy`: `swift build --target TurboFieldfareAgent` exited 0
with `Build complete! (11.77 sec.)` on base commit
`199855c0bd523c7ce275d3227fd92cf8579910fc` plus local changes, Mac14,9 / Apple
M2 Pro / 32 GB RAM, macOS 26.6.2 (25G83), Apple Swift 6.4
(`swiftlang-6.4.0.34.1 clang-2100.3.34.1`). Existing Metal Sendable warnings
remain. The initial sandboxed build exited 1 with
`error opening '/Users/peter.johnson/.cache/clang/ModuleCache/Swift-7JL1KBZ3A6V3.swiftmodule' for output: /Users/peter.johnson/.cache/clang/ModuleCache: Operation not permitted`
and `unable to load standard library for target 'arm64-apple-macosx14.0'`;
the successful retry used approved compiler-cache access. No model was run;
clipboard interaction was not exercised. No model-run or benchmark protocol
applied, and no other protocol deviations occurred.

## Model-free checks

```bash
Scripts/test.sh --filter 'TerminalTranscriptTests|StatusLineTests|SecurityTests|ACPExecutableTests'
python3 Scripts/test-agent-editor.py
python3 Scripts/test-agent-transcript.py
```

The transcript script compiles the real Swift presentation and C editor into a
temporary harness. It exercises plain, CSI-u, and xterm Ctrl-O, multiline and
Unicode drafts, long output, generation input, terminal resizing, and pipes. It
does not load the model.

## Verification record — 2026-09-16

Base commit: `199855c0bd523c7ce275d3227fd92cf8579910fc`, with the local
Ctrl-O changes and pre-existing file-reference changes in the working tree.
Hardware: Mac14,9, Apple M2 Pro, 32 GiB RAM. macOS 26.6.2 (25G83).
Compiler: Apple Swift 6.4 (`swiftlang-6.4.0.34.1`,
`clang-2100.3.34.1`), target `arm64-apple-macosx26.0`.

| Exact command | Exit | Completion footer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `swift build --target TurboFieldfareAgent` | 0 | `Build complete! (11.89 sec.)` |
| `Scripts/test.sh --filter 'TerminalTranscriptTests\|StatusLineTests\|SecurityTests'` | 0 | `Build complete! (15.81 sec.)`; `Executed 15 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.007 (0.010) seconds` |
| `Scripts/test.sh --filter 'TerminalTranscriptTests\|StatusLineTests\|SecurityTests\|ACPExecutableTests'` | 0 | `Build complete! (6.05 sec.)`; `Executed 19 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 1.034 (1.039) seconds` |
| `python3 Scripts/test-agent-editor.py` | 0 | `31 terminal editor checks passed.` |
| `python3 Scripts/test-agent-transcript.py` | 0 | `14 transcript PTY/pipe checks passed.` |

The final package-test timing footer was:

```text
Test Suite 'TurboFieldfareAgentTests.xctest' passed at 2026-09-16 15:41:38.756.
     Executed 19 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 1.034 (1.038) seconds
Test Suite 'Selected tests' passed at 2026-09-16 15:41:38.756.
     Executed 19 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 1.034 (1.039) seconds
```

These are model-free functional checks, not performance measurements. No model
was loaded, installed, duplicated, or terminated. No runtime defaults or
experimental controls changed. Package tests used `Scripts/test.sh`; the PTY
scripts build temporary presentation/editor harnesses directly.

The first sandboxed build and package-test attempts each exited 1 because Swift
could not write its external compiler cache:

```text
error: error opening '/Users/peter.johnson/.cache/clang/ModuleCache/Swift-7JL1KBZ3A6V3.swiftmodule' for output: /Users/peter.johnson/.cache/clang/ModuleCache: Operation not permitted
error: unable to load standard library for target 'arm64-apple-macosx14.0'
```

Both commands were rerun with approved cache access. The build reported existing
Metal `Sendable` warnings in `RealForwardRunner.swift`. The initial process-list
and hardware queries were sandbox-blocked; hardware was obtained with approved
read access. Model-run preflight and community benchmarks were not applicable.

During PTY-driver development, interim runs exited 1 for invalid Tab-input
fixtures and for assuming a prompt marker stays visible when the draft exceeds
the screen. The Tab fixture was removed (plain Tab is an editor command, not
literal insertion); layout-level Tab coverage remains. One oversized-input run
stalled on test-driver backpressure and was interrupted (exit 130), stopping only
its own temporary harness. The driver now drains output while feeding input,
and the oversized-draft check passes. No required checks remain failing.
